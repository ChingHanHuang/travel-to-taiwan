                If you want to have some delicious BBQ, this is a great place I would recommand. There are many branches in Taipei city, so go to find one and try it by yourself!

                Today I went to the BBQ restaurant at Da'an District, since there was a Jazz festival in Da'an part, my friends and I decided to picnic there to enjoy the music and have some BBQ.
                This was my first time to try their food. I like BBQ, but most BBQ restaurants are expensive, and usually they are not enough to me. But this restaurant's food is cheaper, so I
                think we can give it a try.</p>

                When we got there, there were so many food in the refrigerator, such as corn, bell peppers, pork with tomato (this one is so good!), mushroom, and so on.
                We just grabed a bowl first to put the BBQs we wanted, and then after finishing, just brought your bowl to the counter, the waiter will count how much price your food are.
